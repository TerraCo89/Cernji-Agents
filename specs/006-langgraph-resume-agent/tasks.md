# Tasks: LangGraph Resume Agent

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-langgraph-resume-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests REQUESTED per plan.md - Three-tier testing strategy (contract, integration, unit)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single-file Python application: `apps/resume-agent-langgraph/resume_agent_langgraph.py`
- Tests: `apps/resume-agent-langgraph/tests/`
- All paths are absolute from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create directory structure: `apps/resume-agent-langgraph/` with subdirectories `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`
- [X] T002 Initialize UV project with `pyproject.toml` in `apps/resume-agent-langgraph/` with dependencies: LangGraph, FastMCP 2.0, Pydantic, sentence-transformers, langchain-text-splitters, sqlite-vec, pytest

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [X] T010 Import existing DAL functions from `apps/resume-agent/resume_agent.py` (data_read_*, data_write_* functions) - reuse without modification
- [X] T011 Initialize FastMCP server in `apps/resume-agent-langgraph/resume_agent_langgraph.py` with MCP server name "Resume Agent LangGraph"
- [X] T012 Initialize LangGraph SqliteSaver checkpointer with `data/workflow_checkpoints.db` connection string
- [X] T013 Implement observability hook integration helper function that emits events (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionEnd) to existing observability server

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with US1)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 + US2 completion (reuses their nodes)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with US1/US2/US5)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with others)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with others)
- **User Story 7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with others)
- **Remaining Tools (Phase 10)**: Depends on Foundational - can start after Phase 2 (parallel with user stories)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Job Analysis)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **US2 (Resume Tailoring)**: Independent - can start after Foundational (may use US1 output but testable with cached job analysis)
- **US5 (Complete Workflow)**: Depends on US1 + US2 nodes (reuses them)
- **US3 (Cover Letter)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **US4 (Portfolio Search)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **US6 (Career History)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **US7 (RAG Pipeline)**: Independent - can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

- Tests FIRST ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Workflow Nodes ‚Üí StateGraph Definition ‚Üí Graph Compilation ‚Üí MCP Tool Wrapper ‚Üí Observability/Performance Tracking
- All tests marked [P] can run in parallel
- All model/node implementations marked [P] can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

**After Phase 2 Foundational completes**, the following can proceed in parallel:
- US1 (Job Analysis) tasks T019-T026
- US2 (Resume Tailoring) tasks T030-T038
- US3 (Cover Letter) tasks T054-T062
- US4 (Portfolio Search) tasks T065-T072
- US6 (Career History) tasks T075-T079
- US7 (RAG Pipeline) tasks T082-T092
- Remaining MCP Tools tasks T094-T107

**US5 (Complete Workflow) can start after US1 + US2 complete** (requires their nodes)

**Phase 11 (Polish) requires all user stories complete**

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Suggested)

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1) = Minimal Viable Product**

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ Job analysis workflow with LangGraph orchestration
- ‚úÖ State persistence and recovery (demonstrates FR-005, SC-002)
- ‚úÖ Caching support (demonstrates FR-013, SC-004)
- ‚úÖ Observability integration (demonstrates FR-010)
- ‚úÖ Partial success error handling (demonstrates FR-007)
- ‚úÖ Contract tests proving backward compatibility (SC-008)

**Value**: Proves LangGraph's core capabilities (state management, orchestration, error handling) with minimal implementation. Can evaluate DX and decide whether to continue before investing in remaining stories.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Phase 1-3 (MVP - Job Analysis only)
2. **Sprint 2**: Phase 4-5 (Resume Tailoring + Complete Workflow - demonstrates full orchestration)
3. **Sprint 3**: Phase 6-7 (Cover Letter + Portfolio - completes P1/P2 stories)
4. **Sprint 4**: Phase 8-9 (Career History + RAG - completes P3 stories)
5. **Sprint 5**: Phase 10-11 (Remaining tools + Polish + Evaluation)

Each sprint delivers independently testable functionality and can be evaluated before proceeding.
