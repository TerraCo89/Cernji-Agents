# Specification Quality Checklist: LangGraph Resume Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… All checks passed

The specification is complete and ready for planning:

- **7 user stories** prioritized (P1-P3) covering all major workflows
- **15 functional requirements** clearly defined with specific capabilities
- **10 success criteria** with measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- **6 edge cases** identified with resolution strategies
- **Clear scope boundaries** defined in Out of Scope section
- **Dependencies and constraints** documented for planning phase

**Note on Success Criteria**: While some criteria reference specific technologies (e.g., "LangGraph implementation"), this is acceptable because the feature itself is explicitly about comparing LangGraph to the existing Claude Agent SDK approach. The experiment nature is part of the business requirement.

**Ready to proceed to**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if user wants to refine any aspects)
