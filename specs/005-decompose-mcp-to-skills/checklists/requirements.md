# Specification Quality Checklist: Decompose MCP Server to Claude Skills

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**:
- Specification correctly focuses on WHAT (decompose MCP into skills) and WHY (zero-setup, discoverable within Claude Code)
- No implementation details about Python, FastMCP, or specific libraries
- All sections use user-facing language describing capabilities and outcomes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- All 26 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST/MUST NOT language
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time thresholds, percentages, feature counts)
- 8 edge cases identified covering failure scenarios
- Out of scope section clearly defines boundaries
- Dependencies and assumptions sections are comprehensive

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 4 user stories prioritized (P1-P3) with independent test scenarios
- Each user story includes 2-4 acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria align with user stories (workflow timing, feature parity, error handling)
- Technical Constraints section appropriately documents Claude Skills framework limitations without prescribing implementation

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**All checklist items passed**. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Strengths**:
1. Clear decomposition strategy: 4+ core skills mapped to existing MCP tools
2. Well-defined data flow: Skills receive structured data, return structured output
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage: 8 scenarios addressing failure modes
4. Progressive disclosure pattern: References Claude Skills framework requirements
5. Feature parity goal: 100% of MCP functionality available through skills

**Ready for next phase**: The specification provides sufficient detail for implementation planning without prescribing technical solutions.
