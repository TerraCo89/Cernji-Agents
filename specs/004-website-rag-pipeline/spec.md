# Feature Specification: Website RAG Pipeline for Career Applications

**Feature Branch**: `004-website-rag-pipeline`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Resume Agent - A RAG pipeline for processing websites for use when helping the user find jobs or generate documents. Things like company information for prospective job applications, and blogs on topics like how to get jobs in Japan."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Extract Company Information from Job Posting Website (Priority: P1)

A user finds a job posting on a company website or job board and wants to extract relevant company information, culture details, and role requirements to personalize their application materials.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical use case - extracting structured information from job postings is the foundation for generating tailored resumes and cover letters. Without this, none of the downstream application generation features can work effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a job posting URL and verifying that the system extracts company name, role details, requirements, and culture information into a structured format that can be queried.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a job posting URL, **When** user requests information extraction, **Then** system returns structured data including company name, role title, key requirements, and company culture indicators
2. **Given** a Japanese job board URL, **When** user requests extraction, **Then** system correctly handles Japanese text and returns bilingual or translated content
3. **Given** a previously processed URL, **When** user requests the same URL again, **Then** system returns cached results without re-processing
4. **Given** an invalid or inaccessible URL, **When** user attempts extraction, **Then** system provides clear error message with suggested next steps

**Performance Requirements** (see Constitution VI):
- [ ] Response time: <10s for initial extraction, <1s for cached results
- [ ] Error handling: Graceful degradation when webpage structure is unexpected, with user-friendly feedback
- [ ] Observability: Log extraction start/completion, cache hits/misses, and any parsing errors

### User Story 2 - Process Career Advice Blogs and Articles (Priority: P2)

A user wants to extract actionable insights from career advice blogs, particularly articles about finding jobs in Japan, visa requirements, or industry-specific guidance, to inform their job search strategy.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for user guidance, this is secondary to the core job application workflow. Users can manually read articles, but extracting structured insights enhances the application process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a blog article URL (e.g., "How to get a tech job in Japan") and verifying the system extracts key recommendations, tips, and structured advice that can be referenced when generating application materials.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a career blog URL, **When** user requests processing, **Then** system extracts key insights, actionable tips, and relevant statistics
2. **Given** an article about Japan job search, **When** user requests processing, **Then** system identifies visa requirements, cultural considerations, and application best practices
3. **Given** multiple related articles, **When** user asks a question, **Then** system synthesizes information across all processed articles

**Performance Requirements** (see Constitution VI):
- [ ] Response time: <15s for article processing, <2s for querying processed content
- [ ] Error handling: Handle paywalled content gracefully, provide partial results when available
- [ ] Observability: Track article processing metrics and query patterns

---

### User Story 3 - Query Processed Content for Application Generation (Priority: P1)

A user has processed job postings and career articles and wants to query this information to generate tailored resume sections, cover letter talking points, or identify skill gaps.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for the end-to-end workflow. The RAG pipeline must support semantic search and retrieval to power application generation features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pre-loading sample processed content, then querying with questions like "What are the key requirements for this role?" or "What company values should I emphasize?" and verifying relevant, accurate responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** processed job postings, **When** user asks "What are the main technical requirements?", **Then** system returns ranked list of requirements with source citations
2. **Given** processed company information, **When** user asks "What company values should I highlight?", **Then** system identifies cultural fit points with examples from source material
3. **Given** multiple processed jobs, **When** user asks "Which roles match my Python background?", **Then** system compares requirements across jobs and ranks by relevance
4. **Given** processed career advice, **When** user asks "How should I approach Japanese companies?", **Then** system synthesizes cross-article guidance with specific recommendations

**Performance Requirements** (see Constitution VI):
- [ ] Response time: <3s for semantic search queries
- [ ] Error handling: Handle ambiguous queries with clarifying follow-up questions
- [ ] Observability: Track query performance, relevance scoring, and user satisfaction signals

### User Story 4 - Manage Processed Content Library (Priority: P3)

A user wants to view, organize, and update their library of processed websites, including marking items as stale, deleting outdated content, or refreshing specific entries.

**Why this priority**: This is a supporting feature for long-term usage but not critical for the initial workflow. Users can function without library management by simply re-processing URLs as needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by processing several URLs, then listing them, filtering by date or source, and verifying update/delete operations work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple processed websites, **When** user requests library view, **Then** system displays list with URL, type (job/article), processing date, and summary
2. **Given** an outdated entry, **When** user requests refresh, **Then** system re-processes the URL and updates stored content
3. **Given** a library entry, **When** user requests deletion, **Then** system removes content and confirms action
4. **Given** library entries, **When** user filters by date or keyword, **Then** system returns matching subset

**Performance Requirements** (see Constitution VI):
- [ ] Response time: <1s for library listings, <10s for refresh operations
- [ ] Error handling: Confirm destructive operations (delete), handle refresh failures gracefully
- [ ] Observability: Track library size, staleness metrics, and refresh patterns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a website uses dynamic content loading (JavaScript-heavy SPAs)?
- How does the system handle websites with anti-scraping measures (rate limiting, CAPTCHA)?
- What happens when a job posting is removed or the URL becomes invalid?
- How does the system handle mixed-language content (e.g., Japanese job posting with English requirements section)?
- What happens when document structure varies significantly across different job boards?
- How does the system handle very large documents (e.g., 50+ page company handbooks)?
- What happens when multiple users process the same URL simultaneously?
- How does the system handle websites that require authentication or are behind paywalls?

## Assumptions *(if applicable)*

- Users primarily target English-language and Japanese-language job postings
- Most target websites are publicly accessible without authentication
- Users have permission to access and process the websites they provide URLs for
- The existing Resume Agent SQLite database can be extended to store RAG pipeline data
- Vector embeddings will be required for semantic search (implementation detail omitted per spec guidelines)
- Processed content retention follows standard practice: stored indefinitely unless user deletes, with staleness warnings after 30 days
- Users will primarily interact with this feature through MCP tools and slash commands (existing Resume Agent patterns)
- Asynchronous processing with notifications is preferred over synchronous blocking operations for better user experience
- Reference implementation patterns available from Archon project RAG pipeline (https://github.com/coleam00/Archon)

## Dependencies *(if applicable)*

- Existing Resume Agent MCP server architecture (apps/resume-agent/)
- SQLite database for persistent storage
- Internet connectivity for fetching website content
- Existing slash command framework (.claude/commands/)
- Playwright browser automation (already used for job posting fetching)
- Data access layer patterns established in Phase 2

## Out of Scope *(if applicable)*

- Real-time monitoring of job postings for updates
- Automated application submission
- Multi-user collaboration on shared content libraries
- Content processing for websites requiring authentication or payment
- Translation services (system stores content as-is, relies on Claude's multilingual capabilities for querying)
- Chrome extension or browser plugin for one-click processing

## Open Questions *(if applicable)*

None at this time. All critical decisions have been made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.
