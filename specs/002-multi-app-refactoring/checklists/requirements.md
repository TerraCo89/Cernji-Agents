# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-App Architecture Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review:**
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT (multi-app architecture, observability, isolation) without specifying HOW to implement
- ✅ User stories describe value to developers using the system (maintaining functionality, monitoring agents, easy startup)
- ✅ Written in plain language accessible to project stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Review:**
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are well-defined based on the refactoring plan
- ✅ Requirements use testable language (MUST, specific capabilities)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (100% functionality, <1 second event display, 10 seconds startup)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of TypeScript, Vue, Bun in criteria)
- ✅ Each user story has acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover key failure modes (server down, missing files, concurrent access, WebSocket disconnect)
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- ✅ Dependencies (Disler repo, Bun, UV, SQLite) and Assumptions (Windows, localhost, SQLite locking) are documented

**Feature Readiness Review:**
- ✅ Functional requirements map to acceptance criteria in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover: maintaining resume agent (P1), observability dashboard (P2), single command startup (P3), app isolation (P1)
- ✅ Success criteria define measurable outcomes (100% functionality, same performance, 1s event display, 10s startup, zero path errors)
- ✅ Specification maintains focus on business value without technical implementation

**Status**: ✅ All checklist items pass - specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
