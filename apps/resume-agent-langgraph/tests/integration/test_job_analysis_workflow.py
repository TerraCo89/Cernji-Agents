Integration Tests for Job Analysis Workflow (T016-T017)

These tests verify the complete job analysis workflow orchestration:
- LangGraph StateGraph execution
- Node sequencing (cache check → analysis → finalize)
- State transitions
- Error accumulation
- Performance tracking
- Observability events

Integration scope:
- Multiple nodes working together
- Workflow-level caching behavior
- Checkpoint persistence (MemorySaver)
- Partial success scenarios
