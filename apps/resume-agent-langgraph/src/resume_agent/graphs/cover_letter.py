    Build the cover letter generation workflow.

    Flow:
    1. START -> prepare_context: Extract context from job analysis and tailored resume
    2. prepare_context -> generate_letter: Generate cover letter with LLM
    3. generate_letter -> review_letter: Review quality and provide score
    4. review_letter -> END: Complete workflow

    Optional Enhancement (currently disabled):
    - Conditional edge after review_letter:
      - If review_score < 70: regenerate letter (loop back to generate_letter)
      - If review_score >= 70: END
      - Maximum 2 iterations to prevent infinite loops

    The workflow includes:
    - Context preparation from job analysis and tailored resume
    - LLM-powered cover letter generation with storytelling
    - Quality review with scoring and suggestions
    - Error accumulation for partial success
    - Performance tracking via duration_ms
