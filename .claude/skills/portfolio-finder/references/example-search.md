Repository Access
All examples are in private repositories. To share with interviewers:

Option 1: Temporary access (recommended)
- Add interviewer's GitHub username as collaborator
- Remove access after interview process

Option 2: Code samples
- Prepare sanitized code snippets (remove proprietary data)
- Create a public gist with key files
- Walk through during technical interview

Option 3: Make repository public (use caution)
- Only if no proprietary information
- Career-assistant is safe to make public (no client data)
- ddwl-platform contains business logic - keep private
```

For Cover Letter:
Be honest about the skill gap:
- "While my GitHub portfolio focuses on application development, I have hands-on Kubernetes experience from [previous role/company]"
- "I'm passionate about infrastructure-as-code and have been studying Terraform [mention any courses/certifications]"
- Emphasize: Willingness to learn, Docker expertise as foundation, understanding of DevOps principles

For Interview Preparation:
1. Prepare to discuss Docker expertise in depth (this is your strongest proof point)
2. Create a demo project if possible:
   - Simple Kubernetes deployment (minikube + kubectl)
   - Terraform module (provision AWS resources)
   - Share as public repo to demonstrate learning
3. Be ready to discuss DevOps concepts even without code examples:
   - CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code principles, GitOps workflow

Repository Access
Docker examples are visible in public repositories (Cernji-Agents).

Recommendation:
Consider creating public demo projects for missing technologies before applying:
