Hiring Manager
Cookpad
Tokyo, Japan

Dear Hiring Manager,

When I discovered Cookpad's mission to make everyday cooking fun, it resonated deeply with my passion for building products that improve daily life. As a backend engineer with 8 years of experience scaling systems for millions of users, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to a platform that brings joy to home cooks worldwide.

In my role at D&D Worldwide Logistics, I led the development of a customer matching system that reduced manual matching time by 75%. This required designing a RAG pipeline with semantic search capabilities—similar to the recommendation challenges Cookpad faces when connecting users with relevant recipes. The system now processes over 10,000 daily searches with sub-200ms response times, demonstrating my ability to build scalable systems that directly impact user experience.

My experience with microservices architecture and PostgreSQL optimization would translate directly to Cookpad's technical challenges. At my current company, I refactored a monolithic application into 12 microservices, improving deployment frequency by 300% and reducing system downtime from 4 hours/month to less than 30 minutes. This architectural work required the same attention to data consistency and service communication that's critical in a high-traffic platform like Cookpad.

I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my experience in scalable backend systems and user-focused development to Cookpad's mission. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background in building high-performance systems can contribute to making everyday cooking even more enjoyable for millions of users. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Kris Cernjavic

Hiring Manager
GitHub
Remote

Dear Hiring Team,

As a long-time contributor to the open source community and daily GitHub user, I've always admired how GitHub balances powerful functionality with an intuitive developer experience. When I saw the Frontend Engineer opening, I knew this was the opportunity I'd been waiting for—to help build the tools that millions of developers, including myself, rely on every day.

My frontend engineering background centers on performance and user experience. In my current role, I led a performance optimization initiative that reduced our React application's initial load time from 4.2 seconds to 1.1 seconds—a 74% improvement that directly increased user engagement by 32%. This involved implementing code splitting, lazy loading, and optimizing our Webpack configuration, techniques that would be directly applicable to GitHub's massive web interface.

Beyond performance, I'm passionate about building component libraries that scale. I designed and implemented our company's design system, which is now used across 8 products and has reduced frontend development time by approximately 40%. The system includes 47 reusable React components with comprehensive TypeScript definitions, automated testing, and Storybook documentation. This experience would translate well to contributing to GitHub's internal design system and maintaining consistency across the platform.

I'd love to discuss how my performance optimization expertise and component library experience can contribute to making GitHub's web interface even faster and more delightful for developers worldwide. Thank you for considering my application.

Hiring Manager
Legal Tech Corp
Tokyo, Japan

Dear Hiring Manager,

The intersection of machine learning and legal technology presents fascinating challenges, and Legal Tech Corp's approach to document processing with AI caught my attention. As a data scientist with 5 years of experience in NLP and a strong interest in applying ML to domain-specific problems, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to making legal work more efficient through technology.

My most relevant experience comes from developing a document classification system that processes over 50,000 logistics documents daily. Using PyTorch and transformer-based models, I built a multi-label classifier that achieved 94% accuracy in categorizing shipment documents across 23 categories. This required extensive work with domain-specific language and collaborating closely with subject matter experts—much like the legal domain challenges at Legal Tech Corp. The system reduced manual document review time by 68% and now handles documents in both English and Japanese.

Beyond technical implementation, I've successfully bridged the gap between data science and business stakeholders. In my current role, I regularly present complex ML concepts to non-technical audiences in both Japanese and English, translating technical findings into actionable business insights. This communication skill would be valuable when working with legal professionals to understand their document processing needs and explain model decisions.

I'm eager to apply my NLP expertise and bilingual communication skills to Legal Tech Corp's mission of transforming legal work through AI. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in document processing and domain-specific ML can contribute to your platform's development. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Founders
Example Startup
San Francisco, CA

Hey there,

I thrive in the early-stage startup environment where you build fast, ship faster, and tackle whatever problem needs solving—whether that's frontend, backend, or somewhere in between. When I read about Example Startup's mission and the small, nimble team you're building, I knew I had to reach out.

I've been in the "figure it out as you go" stage before, and I love it. At a previous early-stage startup, I was employee #4 and built our entire initial product—React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, AWS infrastructure. We went from concept to paying customers in 8 weeks because I could move quickly across the full stack without waiting for handoffs. That product now serves 2,000+ active users and generates $400k ARR.

Beyond just coding, I've worn the product hat too. I've run user interviews, analyzed usage data, and made product decisions when needed. In a small team, everyone needs to contribute to the "what" and the "why," not just the "how." I'm energized by that kind of ownership and direct impact on the product direction.

I'd love to chat about what you're building and how I can help get it off the ground. Early-stage product development is where I do my best work, and I'm excited about the possibility of joining your team.

Thanks for reading,
Kris Cernjavic

Hiring Manager
LINE Corporation
Tokyo, Japan

Dear Hiring Manager,

LINE's scale—serving hundreds of millions of users across Asia—presents exactly the kind of technical and organizational challenges that energize me as a staff engineer. After spending 9 years progressing from individual contributor to technical leadership roles, I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my architecture and mentoring experience to a platform that's central to daily communication for so many people.

At D&D Worldwide Logistics, I led the architectural redesign of our core matching platform, which processes millions of queries daily. The original monolith was hitting scaling limits at 500 concurrent users. I designed and implemented a microservices architecture with event-driven communication, horizontal scaling, and comprehensive monitoring. The new system now handles 5,000+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime and sub-200ms p95 response times. This project required coordinating 4 teams across 3 time zones and making critical architectural decisions that would impact the company's product roadmap for years.

Technical leadership for me extends beyond architecture to developing people. I've mentored 8 junior and mid-level engineers over the past 3 years, with 5 of them promoted during that time. I run regular architecture review sessions, created our technical design document template, and established cross-team collaboration practices that reduced integration bugs by 60%. Building strong engineering culture and technical excellence is as important to me as the systems we build.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in large-scale system architecture and engineering leadership can contribute to LINE's continued growth and technical evolution. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Kris Cernjavic
