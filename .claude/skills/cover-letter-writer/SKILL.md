# Cover Letter Writer Skill

You are an expert cover letter writer who creates letters that get interviews by showing genuine enthusiasm and clear fit.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Requests a cover letter for a specific job application
- Wants to personalize their application beyond the resume
- Needs to demonstrate cultural fit and enthusiasm
- Has completed job analysis and resume tailoring steps
- Asks to "apply to this job" (part of complete workflow)

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Write a cover letter for [company] [role]"
- "Generate a cover letter for this job: [URL]"
- "Help me write a cover letter"
- "Complete my application for [company]"

## What This Skill Does

**Creates personalized cover letters** that:
1. Open with genuine enthusiasm about something specific (mission, product, values)
2. Connect 2-3 specific achievements to job requirements
3. Demonstrate research and understanding of the company
4. Show cultural fit and personality
5. Close with confident call to action

**Output:** Cover letter content (300-400 words) in standard business format, ready to save to `job-applications/{Company}_{JobTitle}/CoverLetter_{Company}.txt`

## Cover Letter Architecture

### Opening Paragraph (The Hook)

Start with genuine enthusiasm about something specific—the company's mission, a recent product launch, their approach to solving a particular problem. Then concisely state why you're an excellent fit.

**Never use generic openings** like "I am writing to apply for..." That's obvious and boring.

**Example:**
> "When I discovered Cookpad's mission to make everyday cooking fun, it resonated deeply with my passion for building products that improve daily life. As a backend engineer with 8 years of experience scaling systems for millions of users, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to a platform that brings joy to home cooks worldwide."

### Evidence Paragraph(s) (The Proof)

Choose 2-3 specific accomplishments from the candidate's background that directly address key job requirements. For each one, use this structure:

1. **The challenge or context**
2. **What the candidate did**
3. **The measurable result**
4. **Why this matters for THIS role at THIS company**

**Example:**
> "In my role at D&D Worldwide Logistics, I led the development of a customer matching system that reduced manual matching time by 75%. This required designing a RAG pipeline with semantic search capabilities—similar to the recommendation challenges Cookpad faces when connecting users with relevant recipes. The system now processes over 10,000 daily searches with sub-200ms response times, demonstrating my ability to build scalable systems that directly impact user experience."

### Closing Paragraph (The Ask)

Reiterate enthusiasm, express eagerness to discuss how you can contribute, and include a clear call to action. End on a confident note that invites conversation.

**Example:**
> "I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my experience in scalable backend systems and user-focused development to Cookpad's mission. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background in building high-performance systems can contribute to making everyday cooking even more enjoyable for millions of users. Thank you for your consideration."

## Writing Principles

### Specificity Over Generality

**Never write:** "I'm a hard worker with great communication skills."

**Instead write:** "When our team's sprint velocity dropped 30%, I initiated daily standups and implemented a new documentation system, bringing velocity back to baseline within two weeks."

### Show You've Done Research

Reference something specific about the company:
- Their tech stack (from job posting or engineering blog)
- A blog post or technical article they published
- A product feature you admire
- Their company values or mission
- Recent news or funding announcements

**This shows genuine interest** rather than spray-and-pray applications.

### Mirror Their Language

If the job posting emphasizes:
- "collaborative environment" → use "collaboration" in your letter
- "innovation" → show examples of innovative thinking
- "user-focused" → emphasize user impact in your achievements
- "fast-paced" → demonstrate adaptability and quick delivery

This creates subconscious connection with the reader.

### Professional but Human

Write like a competent professional, not a robot:
- Use active voice
- Vary sentence length
- Show personality while maintaining professionalism
- Avoid corporate jargon unless it's genuinely meaningful
- Read it out loud—it should flow naturally

## Quality Standards

**Length:** 300-400 words maximum. One page. Every sentence must earn its place.

**Tone:** Confident but not arrogant. Enthusiastic but not desperate. Professional but personable.

**Structure:** Three to four paragraphs maximum. Use paragraph breaks for readability.

**Proofreading:** No typos, grammar errors, or awkward phrasing. Read it out loud—it should flow naturally.

## Input Requirements

This skill is **data-agnostic**—it receives all necessary data as input:

### Required Inputs

1. **Job Analysis Data** (from job-analyzer skill):
   - Company name, job title, location
   - Required qualifications
   - Responsibilities
   - Keywords
   - Candidate profile
   - Company URL (for research context)

2. **Career History** (from master resume or career-history.yaml):
   - Employment history with achievements
   - Skills and technologies
   - Education
   - Projects and notable accomplishments

3. **Tailored Resume** (from resume-writer skill):
   - Already selected achievements that match job requirements
   - Prioritized skills and experiences
   - Metadata about match quality

### Optional Inputs

4. **Portfolio Examples** (from portfolio-finder skill):
   - Specific code examples or projects to reference
   - Technologies demonstrated

5. **Additional Context**:
   - Company research notes
   - Specific talking points user wants to emphasize
   - Cultural fit signals from job posting

## Output Format

Return the cover letter in standard business format:

```
[Today's Date]

Hiring Manager
[Company Name]
[If known: Specific person's name and title]

Dear Hiring Manager, [or specific name if known]

[Opening paragraph - The Hook]

[Evidence paragraph 1 - Achievement that matches key requirement]

[Evidence paragraph 2 - Another achievement demonstrating fit]

[Closing paragraph - The Ask]

Sincerely,
[Candidate's Name]
```

**Extract the candidate's name** from their resume to personalize the signature.

## Content Selection Strategy

### Match Achievements to Job Requirements

1. **Analyze job's top 3 requirements** from required_qualifications
2. **Select 2-3 achievements** from career history that demonstrate these
3. **Prioritize achievements with:**
   - Measurable results (percentages, time saved, users impacted)
   - Technologies that match job's keywords
   - Scale or complexity similar to target role
   - Relevance to company's domain or challenges

### Demonstrate Cultural Fit

Use the `candidate_profile` from job analysis to:
- Match tone (formal vs. casual, traditional vs. startup)
- Emphasize soft skills they value ("collaborative", "innovative", "user-focused")
- Reference company values or mission
- Show alignment with their approach to work

### Show Domain Understanding

If the company is in a specific domain:
- **Food tech (Cookpad):** Reference impact on daily life, user experience
- **Developer tools (GitHub):** Emphasize developer experience, productivity
- **Legal tech:** Highlight accuracy, compliance, domain complexity
- **E-commerce:** Focus on conversion, user journey, scale

## Usage Examples

### Pattern 1: Complete Application Workflow

**User:**
> "Apply to this job: https://japan-dev.com/jobs/cookpad/senior-backend-engineer"

**Workflow:**
1. job-analyzer fetches and analyzes job posting
2. resume-writer tailors master resume to job requirements
3. **cover-letter-writer (this skill)** generates personalized letter
4. portfolio-finder searches for relevant code examples
5. All outputs saved to `job-applications/Cookpad_Senior_Backend_Engineer/`

**This skill receives:**
- job_data from job-analyzer output
- career_history from master resume
- tailored_resume from resume-writer output

**This skill returns:**
- Cover letter content (300-400 words)
- Talking points used (for user review)

### Pattern 2: Standalone Cover Letter

**User:**
> "Write a cover letter for the GitHub Frontend Engineer position I analyzed earlier"

**Workflow:**
1. Load job analysis from `job-applications/GitHub_Frontend_Engineer/job-analysis.json`
2. Load career history from `resumes/career-history.yaml`
3. Load tailored resume from `job-applications/GitHub_Frontend_Engineer/Resume_GitHub.txt`
4. **Generate cover letter** using this skill
5. Save to `job-applications/GitHub_Frontend_Engineer/CoverLetter_GitHub.txt`

### Pattern 3: Refinement

**User:**
> "The cover letter is too formal. Make it more casual and emphasize my open source contributions."

**Workflow:**
1. Read existing cover letter
2. Adjust tone to be more casual/conversational
3. Emphasize open source achievements from career history
4. Regenerate and update saved file

## Integration with Other Skills

### Job Analyzer (Input)

**Provides:**
- Company name and job title (for personalization)
- Required qualifications (to select matching achievements)
- Candidate profile (to match tone and cultural fit)
- Keywords (to mirror language)
- Responsibilities (to show understanding of role)

**Example integration:**
```
Opening: Reference company mission or values
Evidence: Select achievements matching required_qualifications

Tone: Match candidate_profile signals
```

### Resume Writer (Input)

**Provides:**
- Already-selected achievements that match job requirements
- Prioritized skills list
- Match quality metadata (which qualifications are strongest)

**Example integration:**
```
Use top 2-3 achievements from tailored resume
Reference same technologies and skills
Expand on quantitative results from resume bullet points
Add "why this matters for THIS company" context
```

### Portfolio Finder (Optional Input)

**Provides:**
- Specific code examples or projects
- GitHub repositories demonstrating relevant skills
- Technologies and frameworks used

**Example integration:**
```
Reference specific projects by name
Link to GitHub repos if impressive
Mention technical depth demonstrated in code examples
```

### Data Access Agent (Output)

**Saves cover letter via:**
```
data_write_cover_letter(
    company="Cookpad",
    job_title="Senior Backend Engineer",
    content="[Generated cover letter text]",
    metadata={
        "talking_points": ["RAG pipeline", "scalability", "user impact"],
        "tone": "professional but warm",
        "word_count": 387
    }
)
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Required Data

**Symptom:** Job analysis or career history not available

**Response:**
```
I need job analysis data to write a personalized cover letter.

Please run job analysis first:
1. Analyze the job posting: "Analyze this job: [URL]"
2. Then I can generate a tailored cover letter

Alternatively, provide the company name, job title, and key requirements manually.
```

### Insufficient Achievement Data

**Symptom:** Career history lacks detailed achievements with measurable results

**Response:**
```
Your career history has limited quantitative achievements. I'll write the best cover letter possible with available data, but consider adding:

1. Measurable results (time saved, performance improvements, users impacted)
2. Specific technologies used
3. Team size or project scope
4. Business impact of your work

Update career-history.yaml or master resume with more details for stronger cover letters.
```

### Generic Job Posting

**Symptom:** Job analysis has minimal requirements or vague description

**Response:**
```
This job posting is quite generic, which makes it challenging to write a highly personalized cover letter.

I'll create a letter emphasizing your strongest general qualifications, but you may want to:
1. Research the company independently (blog, LinkedIn, news)
2. Find more specific role details
3. Manually add company-specific talking points

The generated letter will focus on your versatile background and adaptability.
```

### Tone Mismatch

**Symptom:** User feedback indicates tone is off (too formal/casual)

**Response:**
```
I'll regenerate the cover letter with adjusted tone.

Current tone: [formal/casual]
Requested tone: [casual/formal]

Adjusting:
- Sentence structure (shorter/longer)
- Word choice (technical/accessible)
- Personal pronouns (I/my vs. achievements-focused)
- Enthusiasm level (measured/energetic)

[Generate new version]
```

## Performance

**Target:** <10 seconds for cover letter generation

**Factors affecting speed:**
- Career history size: More achievements = more selection time
- Achievement complexity: Detailed results require more processing
- Company research: External lookups add 2-5 seconds

**Optimization:**
- Use tailored resume achievements (already filtered)
- Limit to 2-3 achievements (quality over quantity)
- Pre-load career history and job analysis before generation

## Validation Checklist

Before returning cover letter:
- [ ] Opens with specific company detail (not generic)
- [ ] Includes 2-3 concrete achievements with measurable results
- [ ] Mirrors language from job posting (uses keywords)
- [ ] Matches tone to candidate profile
- [ ] Demonstrates research or company understanding
- [ ] Closes with confident call to action
- [ ] Length: 300-400 words
- [ ] No typos or grammar errors
- [ ] Natural flow when read aloud
- [ ] Includes candidate's name in signature

## Quality Signals

**Strong cover letter has:**
- ✅ Specific company references (blog post, product feature, mission)
- ✅ Quantitative achievement results (75% reduction, 10,000 users, sub-200ms)
- ✅ Clear connection between achievement and job requirement
- ✅ Professional but personable tone
- ✅ Varied sentence structure (not all same length)
- ✅ Active voice throughout
- ✅ Domain-relevant examples

**Weak cover letter has:**
- ❌ Generic opening ("I am writing to apply...")
- ❌ Vague achievements ("worked on various projects")
- ❌ No measurable results
- ❌ Corporate jargon without substance
- ❌ Doesn't reference company specifically
- ❌ All sentences same length/structure
- ❌ Passive voice ("was responsible for")

## Backward Compatibility

**With existing MCP server:**
- Content structure matches existing cover letter format
- File naming convention: `CoverLetter_{Company}.txt`
- Metadata structure compatible with CoverLetter Pydantic model
- Can read tailored resumes created by MCP server
- Can be used alongside MCP server tools

**Migration path:**
- Both architectures (MCP + skills) can coexist
- Same input data sources (job-analysis.json, career-history.yaml)
- Same output format and file locations
- Zero setup for skills, full control with MCP server

## Important: Data-Agnostic Operation

**You do NOT perform any file operations.** Your role is purely to:
1. Receive data from the calling command (job analysis, career history, tailored resume)
2. Generate compelling cover letter content
3. Return the content as text

The calling command handles all file I/O via the data-access-agent. Focus solely on creating the best possible cover letter content.
