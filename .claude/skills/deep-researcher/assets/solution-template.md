## Formatting Guidelines

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Good - language specified
const example = 'code';
```

Include complete, runnable examples:
```python
# Good - includes imports
import requests

def fetch_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Usage example
data = fetch_data('https://api.example.com/data')
```

### Links

Format as descriptive text with URL:
```markdown
[Official React Documentation](https://react.dev/): Comprehensive guide to React concepts
```

Not as bare URLs:
```markdown
‚ùå https://react.dev/
```

### Emphasis

**Bold** for key terms, recommendations, and important callouts

*Italic* for emphasis within sentences

`Code formatting` for inline code, commands, and technical terms

### Lists

Use numbered lists for sequential steps:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items:
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

### Tables

Include headers and align columns for readability. Use comparison tables when comparing 3+ options across multiple dimensions.

### Sections

Use `---` horizontal rules to clearly separate major sections and investigation avenues.
